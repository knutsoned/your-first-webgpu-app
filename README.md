# Your First WebGPU App

Conway's Game of Life, built with TypeScript, Vite, and WebGPU, from https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app

Remove everything after line 1 of src/main.ts to go through the tutorial. Then:

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

and open a browser to http://localhost:5137

You can edit src/main.ts in VS Code. You may be prompted to install extensions.
Install them if you want highlighting for the WGSL code.
